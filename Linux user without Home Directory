The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, 
as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. 
They are finished with all apps except for App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.




Create a user named james in App Server 2 without a home directory.
 ssh steve@172.16.238.11
 
 id james
if no user is crated.
then 


sudo useradd -M james

-M option create a user without creating home directory.
